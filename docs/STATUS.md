# Project status & pick-up guide

Last updated: 2026-07-11, at **v0.9.0**. This is the single document to read
(alongside `CLAUDE.md`) to resume work with full context.

## Where things stand

Diorama is feature-complete through the Sims-2000 arc (`docs/DESIGN-sims.md`,
all 7 phases shipped) plus five post-arc batches. Everything below is merged
to `main`, pushed to **both remotes**, released through **v0.9.0**, and
deployed to the live HA instance.

### Remotes, releases, deploy

- `origin` = https://repo.holzhueter.us/eric/diorama.git (Gitea, token in the
  remote URL). `github` = https://github.com/pwsh/diorama.git (gh CLI is
  authenticated as `pwsh`). Push **both** on every ship.
- Release runbook: bump `package.json` version → commit `vX.Y.Z` → tag →
  `git push origin main vX.Y.Z && git push github main vX.Y.Z` →
  `gh release create vX.Y.Z --repo pwsh/diorama --title … --notes …` → the
  `release.yml` workflow builds and attaches `diorama.zip` (HACS asset) —
  poll `gh run list --workflow=release.yml` until success and verify the
  asset. Gitea releases optional (v0.4.0 has one; later ones GitHub-only).
- Deploy to live HA: `npm run deploy` (haDeploy plugin → GVFS SMB share at
  10.0.0.6, `www/community/diorama`, config in gitignored
  `deploy.local.json`). User must hard-refresh / reset the companion-app
  frontend cache afterwards.
- Releases so far: v0.4.0 Sims era → v0.5.0 pathfinding/glass house/cutaway
  → v0.6.0 living avatars (AI avatars, despawn fades, beds, auto-follow) →
  v0.7.0 polish & reachability (UI reorg, sectional fix, colors, step
  lights) → v0.8.0 the cast expands (22 avatars, planar rooms, device
  controls) → v0.9.0 room-label layer, unnamed-room placeholders +
  enclosure feedback, settings version stamp.

### Shipped since the DESIGN-sims arc (reverse order)

- **Avatar system**: 22 selectable models (multi-select checkbox grid per
  mmWave/motion sensor; stable djb2-per-target resolution; legacy
  single/'random' fields still read). Per-kind walk personalities
  (waddle/lumber/strut/moon-bounce) and periodic role thought-bubbles
  (lowest bubble priority, fire while walking too). One parametric rig —
  per-rig proportion fields (`h.hipY` etc.) drive seat/lie/table-IK math.
- **Rooms**: `closedWallLoops` is a planar face extractor (T-junctions,
  crossing chords) — invisible walls subdivide open plans. Sidebar sections
  group items by containing room.
- **Device controls**: fans (dblclick → power + % slider in the light modal;
  `fanEntity` binding), TVs `tv`/`wall_tv` (raycastable `_mediaClickables`;
  click toggles, dblclick → `<diorama-media-config>`: play/pause, volume,
  source, now-playing — only what the entity exposes).
- **Table realism**: seat-center placement clearance 150 mm; pose-side root
  clamp ≥190 mm from host edge; arm IK with elbow-height lower bound
  (`≥ top + 30`); tall-host "sit taller" cheat.
- **Step lights**: forward-only cone (1.0 rad, 60° down, origin 120 mm proud
  of the face), half-disc pools, wall/stair-edge snap, negative heights
  (sunken wash-cone height bug fixed — cylinder took raw negative height).
- **Editor batch**: sectional L/R mirror fix (2D plan is the orientation
  contract; 3D `_w` mirrors X — builders need opposite local-X signs),
  furniture color override + picker, arrow-key nudge (25/100 mm, bypasses
  solvers), wall-collision snap for all placeables except doors/windows,
  chair↔table constraint, stairwell holes clipped per-loop
  (Sutherland–Hodgman, 3 mm inset), Layers section (walls toggle, coverage,
  motion zones, target details), top-bar reorg (floors + imperial in
  sidebar; single 2D/3D toggle at left; delete-floor export-offer+confirm).
- **Motion/nav**: 150 mm nav grid with connectivity regions; carrot-chaser +
  critically damped spring (ω=9, substepped) walking; A* with string-pull;
  stuck-goal respawn-in-region after 3 s; edge-aware despawn (fast drop at
  coverage edge vs 10 s opacity fade — per-rig outline material clones);
  mutual separation with the coincident-pair fix.
- **AI avatars** (`MotionSensor.avatar`): renderer-side wander controller
  drives a virtual raw position through the normal pipeline (sits, uses
  anchors, lies in beds, fades on presence loss).
- **Views**: glass house (`scene3d.glassHouse`, ghost stories in
  `_ghostGroup`), wall cutaway (default on, `_updateWallCutaway` per frame),
  auto-follow camera (`scene3d.autoFollow`, activity-bbox framing, 6 s
  manual-orbit pause), Sims cam (dimetric + 45° azimuth snap), plumbob
  toggle, device-local view memory (`localStorage['diorama:view']`),
  touch-drawer suppression with 24 px left-edge exception.
- **iOS hardening**: `webglcontextrestored` re-render, persistent-tick-error
  overlay, `?debug3d=1` on-screen console. iOS companion-app 3D failure was
  never conclusively reproduced — if it recurs, ask for a `?debug3d=1`
  screenshot and suggest Settings → Companion App → Debugging → Reset
  frontend cache.

## Working practices (established with the user)

- **Model routing** (explicit user directive): Fable = architecture,
  tiebreaking, orchestration, root-cause diagnosis. **Opus 4.8 agents write
  all substantive code** (spawn with `model: 'opus'`, detailed specs, no git
  access). **Sonnet agents do research.** Resume prior agents via
  SendMessage to keep their context.
- **Verification gates**: `npm run typecheck` && `npm run build` (no test
  suite), then headless-Chrome screenshots/title-assertions from the
  deterministic pages in `test-pages/` (see its README for the exact
  commands and baselines). Coordinator independently spot-checks agent
  screenshots before shipping.
- **Ship cadence**: every user-visible batch = one commit (imperative
  subject + wrapped body + `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5`), push both
  remotes, `npm run deploy`. Releases only when the user asks ("cut",
  "push release").
- Every commit message and doc change keeps `CLAUDE.md` load-bearing
  sections current (rendering, activity system, pathfinding, gotchas).

## Open threads / known deferrals

- Dragging a **table** onto chairs doesn't push the table (only dragged
  seats resolve); documented out of scope.
- Ghost floors (glass house) always show walls regardless of the Walls
  layer (intentional; user hasn't objected).
- Custom recipes draw as labeled rects in 2D; 3D front-arrow indicator
  deferred; mounted items not live-parented (re-snap on next drag).
- Privacy blur is a shared static censor sprite; throttled render-to-texture
  mosaic documented as a stretch upgrade.
- Idle activities ranked "consider next" from research: warming hands at a
  lit fireplace (needs Light-fixture anchors, new plumbing), dance-near-TV
  (conflicts with watch_tv, needs disambiguation), window gazing.
- Imported OBJ/MTL models keep their own materials (not toon-converted).
- iOS 3D load failure unconfirmed — see hardening notes above.
- GUIDE.md/info.md were refreshed at v0.4.0; features since then
  (pathfinding, glass house, avatars, device controls, rooms grouping, UI
  reorg) are **not yet in the user guide** — a docs refresh pass is the most
  obvious next chore if the user asks for one.

## Key architecture pointers

`CLAUDE.md` is authoritative. The dense center of the codebase is
`src/three-renderer.ts` (~5.5k lines): toon material factory `_mat`,
outlines `_addOutlines`, blob shadows, humanoid rig + `updateTargets`
(gait/sit/lie/activities/bubbles/nav/despawn — read its inline gotchas:
raw-vs-nav speeds, anti-feedback rule, per-rig constants), nav grid
`_buildNav` + regions, `updateFloor` (walls/floor clipping/anchors/
sit-spots/beds/TVs/rooms), `updateLightsSwitches` (per-kind bodies, fan
rotors, step spotlights), ghost floors, wall cutaway, auto-follow.
`src/ui/three-view.ts` owns the dirty keys — any new renderer input joins a
key or rides the every-frame calls. Persistence gotchas: new top-level
Store fields → `Planner._loadFromHa` list; per-floor fields → `repairFloor`
+ `defaultFloor`.
